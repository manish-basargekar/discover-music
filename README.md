# Goals :

- To make an interface for discovering music based on user selected seeds(like tracks, genre, country, artist)

# Approach:

- Use spotify's /recommendation end point and stepzen backend to utilize spotify's rest endpoint. I used stepzen directives like @rest and @sequence to convert spotify's rest api into graphQl endpoints 

- one of the recommendation seed(country) is determined using ip address of the user. It is done using ip-api


# Functionalities:
- spotify search api to search for music.
- Tweak you recommendations to find similar music based on country, artist, genre or track

# Outcomes

- react web app to tweak and find music.

# What's next for Discover music
- Adding more variable to discover music like tempo, acoustics, danceability etc.
- Adding your favorite music to playlist
- Recommendation presets based on mood, weather
